# Geometry Game
This is a simple geometry game where the program gives the user the coordinates of the low-left and upper-right points of a randomly-generated rectangle. The user is asked to enter the coordinates of a point he/she thinks is located inside the triangle and the program verifies whether that is true or not.

The user is also asked to guess the area of the randomly-generated rectangle and the program displays an appropriate message according to the answer of the user.

This game makes use of *turtle* library to provide visualization in a virtual canvas of the rectangle generated by the program and the point guessed by the user.
